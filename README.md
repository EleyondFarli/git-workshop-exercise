# Getting started with git
Welcome to the Git Workshop by [Wolfpack Digital](https://www.wolfpack-digital.com) x [BEST Cluj-Napoca](https://www.bestcj.ro), where you'll learn how to use git like a Wolf! üí™üèª

In this repository, you'll find a very basic C++ console application that does some arithmetic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication and division.

# To do
For this warm-up exercise, you'll have to:
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your new repository locally
3. Add a new feature to this app to handle the modulo operation by:
   - creating a new branch
   - commiting your feature implementation
   - opening a Pull Request to merge the feature branch into main
4. Add your deskmate as a collaborator and ask for their review on your Pull Request
5. Leave a review for your deskmate and once approved, merge your PRs

That's it! We're all warmed up now! ü•≥
